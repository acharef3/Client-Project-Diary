# Week 1

In the starting week I had a discussion with the team in relation to role delegation to be able to understand each member's perspective on how they would like to operate within the group thereafter I went through a personality questionnaire that determines the role a moslty fit in.

### Questtionare Result:
The personalty types that scored above 80 are: Dynamo, Researcher and Regulator.

#### Dynamo:

These team members are dynamic and outgoing. They are full of energy and tend to drive towards the team objectives ‘regardless of casualties’. They are courageous in the face of problems and try to use their energy to overcome them. They enjoy the pressure involved in teamwork, much of it self-inflicted, as they continually challenge the commitment and effectiveness of other team members; this constant ‘questioning’ tends to ‘keep everyone on their toes’. The ‘Dynamos’ can readily get impatient with other team members and this can lead to irritability and hurt-feelings within the group.

#### Researcher: 
These people are extroverts. They are enthusiastic and curious, always wanting to explore new ideas and enjoying the challenge of the yet unknown. They are particularly useful in gathering useful outside resources (research references or experts willing to help), in order to supplement the knowledge and expertise already existing within the group. Researchers are generally optimistic, but have a tendency to lose interest once the project(s) advances into more mundane phases and the initial excitement of exploration fades away.

#### Regulator:
These team members are generally composed and analytical, acting as the "reality check" for the group. They are driven by logic and accuracy, focusing intently on details and facts rather than general excitement. They are invaluable for quality control and risk assessment, as they naturally scrutinize plans to identify flaws or operational issues that others might overlook. While this prudent approach ensures high standards and prevents costly mistakes, their tendency to focus on "what could go wrong" can sometimes be perceived as pessimism or rigidity, potentially dampening the team's enthusiasm during creative brainstorming sessions.
